## jsTrack

jsTrack is a web-based version of the [Tracker](https://physlets.org/tracker/) software built to run completely in the browser, and compatible with Chromebooks.

jsTrack was built from scratch in order to mimic the basic features Tracker has. It allows you to import a video, create multiple data tracks, create a scale, and track points relative to a set of axes.
